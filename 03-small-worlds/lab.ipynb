    "**How greedy routing decides**: At each step (panel), the current node (red) evaluates all its neighbors and picks the one closest to the target (blue) by Manhattan distance. The chosen neighbor is green; alternatives are yellow with their distances shown. Notice how long-range links (when available) let the algorithm make big jumps early on, while local grid edges handle the final approach. This is why r=2 works — the long-range links provide useful shortcuts at every distance scale."
